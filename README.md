# Sales Data Analysis

This repository contains a Python script that analyzes sales data from a collection of CSV files. The script performs data cleaning, transformation, and analysis to answer key business questions.

## Project Overview

The project aims to:

-   Consolidate sales data from multiple monthly CSV files into a single DataFrame.
-   Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values and correcting data types.
-   Augment the data with additional informative columns such as month, sales, and city.
-   Perform exploratory data analysis to answer business questions, including:
    -      What was the best month for sales and how much was earned that month?
    -      Which city had the highest number of sales?
    -      What time should advertisements be displayed to maximize customer purchases?
    -      What products are most often sold together?
    -      Which product sold the most and why?
